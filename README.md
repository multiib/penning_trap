# Particle simulation in the Penning Trap
A Penning trap is a device for the storage of charged particles using a homogeneous axial magnetic field and an inhomogeneous quadrupole electric field. This project aims to simulate particles in such a device using iterative numerical methods.

## How to run this code?

To compile and link the source code:
```
make compile
```
To only save plots:
```
make plot
```

To compile and save plots:
```
make compile plot

The main dunction is meant to be easly customisble for own simulations.
